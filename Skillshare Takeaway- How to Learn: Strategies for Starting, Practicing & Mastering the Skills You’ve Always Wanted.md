**Mike's method for learning - Quick method of learning**    
1. Start learning immediately an idea pops into your head  
2. Do very little research  
3. Have a well defined goal  
4. Document your progress  
5. Stay disciplined  
6. Embrace the struggle  

**How we learn and mindset**
1. Just like muscles our minds can adapt and grow with training
2. Learning seemingly useless skills like e.g. spinning a book makes your brain  
   fitter to learn other skills faster  

**Getting started : Finding passion**
1. You discover passion by trying out different things till you find the thing that captures unusual interest
2. Passion gives you the grit to overcome the obstacles in the learning process

**Practising smart**
1. Squeeze in time during your day without modifying your routine dramatically, e.g. place a rubik's cube   
   on your desk so you have easy access to it at all times
2. Utilize the pomodoro technique
3. There are two kinds of practise
   * Fun- Good for the morale, not very efficient
   * Deliberate- Efficient, not very fun
   Blending fun practise with deliberate practise gives the best results- accelerating your progress maintainin high levels of              motivation
