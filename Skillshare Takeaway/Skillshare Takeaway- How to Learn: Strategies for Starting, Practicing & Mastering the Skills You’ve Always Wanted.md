Summary >  

**Mike's method for learning - Quick method of learning**    
1. Start learning immediately an idea pops into your head  
2. Do very little research  
3. Have a well defined goal  
4. Document your progress  
5. Stay disciplined  
6. Embrace the struggle  

**How we learn and mindset**
1. Just like muscles our minds can adapt and grow with training
2. Learning seemingly useless skills like e.g. spinning a book makes your brain  
   fitter to learn other skills faster  

**Getting started : Finding passion**
1. You discover passion by trying out different things till you find the thing that captures unusual interest
2. Passion gives you the grit to overcome the obstacles in the learning process

**Practising smart**
1. Squeeze in time during your day without modifying your routine dramatically, e.g. place a rubik's cube   
   on your desk so you have easy access to it at all times
2. Utilize the pomodoro technique
3. There are two kinds of practise
   * Fun- Good for the morale, not very efficient
   * Deliberate- Efficient, not very fun
   Blending fun practise with deliberate practise gives the best results- accelerating your progress maintainin high levels of              motivation
4. Self-diagnosis to pin point the problem in your technique. Change one thing in your technique at a time to isolate the problem and      see the results.

**Pushing through the dip**
1. Acknowledge that you are in the dip (frustration phase- no progress) and accept its inevitability
2. Deliberate scheduled practise is key. Keep on practising regardless of whether you feel like it or not
3. Shift slightly to the 'Fun' kind of practise during this phase
4. Use shorter practise sessions
5. If it's a skill that involves physical engagement, taking a few days off might boost your morale
6. Split the skill further into component parts. Little successes can overshadow the overwhelm.

**Success : Setting and refining goals**
1. Set a clear goal.
2. Do not set goals that are either way too easy to be worthless or either way too ambitious to be unachievable
3. Redefine your goals as you progress or see intricacies of the process.
4. Aim is to maximize your enjoyment when learning a new skill.
