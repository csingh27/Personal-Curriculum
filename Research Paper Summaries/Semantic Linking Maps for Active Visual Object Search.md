**Semantic Linking Maps for Active Visual Object Search**  

**TASK DEFINITION**  
*Exploit inter-object spatial relations for object search*  


**ASSUMPTION**  
* Metric map of the environment is given  

**CORE IDEAS**  
* Exploit inter-object spatial relations for object search  
* Probabilistic modeling of spatial relations between different objects (in,on, etc. relations)  
* Semantic linking maps are used to maintain beliefs (represented by particles) over object locations in the metric map  
* Hybrid search strategy to select robot view pose during active visual search
